# DEVICES:
# - SHARED folder
#   * for the case that we had a platform with several hosts in which the containers could be
#     hosted, the shared folder could be a folder that is shared using NFS and that is mounted
#     in the virtualization hosts. Then preparing the shared folder will consist of creating the
#     folder and we could connect the device.
#   * a more complex case will be to create the shared folder in a NFS Server, updating the /etc/exports
#     file, reexporting and mounting on the flight and then the shared folder will be available.
#     At this time I cannot see any advantage on using this approach (which is complex) instead
#     of the previous one (which is simple).
#   * an even more complex case will involve connecting a iscsi end-point, which would be mounted
#     in a server that will share the filesystem using NFS, etc. And we could use one of the two
#     previous approaches.
#
#   * in case that we wanted to limit the space of disk to share, we could make the following workaround
#     in the host that is sharing the filesystem:
#       $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/shareddisk bs=1G count=1
#       $ mkfs.ext3 /path/to/shareddisk
#       $ sudo mount -o loop,rw /path/to/shareddisk /path/to/local/mountpoint
#
#     and then make that mount point available for the container. That will limit (and allocate) the 
#     size of the shared space.
#
# - HOME
#   * is a special case of the shared folder
#
# - SYSFOLDER
#   * sysfolder (a folder that already exists in the host is exposed to the container)
#       > at this time, a shared folder is (in part) a sysfolder which is mounted using NFS and 
#         where it is created a folder
#
# - TODO:
#   * sysfile (a file that already exists in the host is exposed to the container)
#   * gpu (a gpu that can be connected to the container)
#   * network (other networks than the "cluster one")
